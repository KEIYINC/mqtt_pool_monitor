# mqtt_pool_monitor

A Flutter project to monitor pool sensor data in real-time using MQTT.

## Overview

This Flutter application is designed to monitor and display real-time pool sensor data, including pH levels, temperature, chlorine concentration, and other parameters from an IoT device using the MQTT protocol. It enables seamless data retrieval and visualization on a mobile platform.

---

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have **Flutter** installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the project.

### Prerequisites

- Install **Flutter** from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- Make sure you have a working **MQTT broker** setup to send the sensor data.
- An **ESP H2** or compatible IoT device that can send data over MQTT.

### Installing Dependencies

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mqtt_pool_monitor.git
Navigate into the project folder:
bash
Kopyala
Düzenle
cd mqtt_pool_monitor
Install the required Flutter packages:
bash
Kopyala
Düzenle
flutter pub get
Configuration
Before running the app, you need to configure the MQTT broker information in the code:

Open the mqtt_service.dart file.
Replace the following placeholders with your actual values:
dart
Kopyala
Düzenle
final String broker = "your_broker_ip";  // MQTT broker IP address
final int port = 1883;  // MQTT broker port
final String clientId = "flutter_client";  // MQTT client ID
final String username = "your_username";  // (Optional) MQTT username
final String password = "your_password";  // (Optional) MQTT password
final List<String> topics = ["pool/ph", "pool/temp", "pool/chlorine"];  // List of MQTT topics to subscribe to
Usage
Run the app:
bash
Kopyala
Düzenle
flutter run
The app will attempt to connect to the MQTT broker and subscribe to the configured topics. Once connected, it will display the real-time sensor data, such as the pH value and pool temperature, on the screen.
Features
Real-time Data: Displays pool sensor data in real-time by subscribing to MQTT topics.
Simple UI: Clean, easy-to-use interface that shows current pool parameters.
Scalable: Easily extendable for additional sensor data and functionality.
